/*
  PENAL CODES DATA
  =================
  This is the only file you need to touch to load in the real code list.
  Replace the sample entries below with the full set. Each entry looks like:

  {
    class: 6,                        // the number in "(6)15" — severity class
    code: "15",                      // the number after the class — code number
    title: "Speeding (5-15 over)",   // charge name
    fine: 250,                       // dollar amount, no $ sign, no commas
    jailDays: 0,                     // 0 = no jail time attached to this charge
  },

  Notes:
  - "class" and "code" together make the displayed code, e.g. (6)15
  - Leave jailDays at 0 if a charge never carries jail time.
  - Order doesn't matter — search works across all entries.
  - You can have duplicate classes, that's expected (most departments group
    charges by class, e.g. all Class 6 = traffic).
